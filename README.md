# Babymap-App
A handy map for parents and their babys/toddlers.

This App is under construction.

The final app will show your location and depending on what you need right now (change a diaper, feed your baby, find a playground ect.) it will give you all
the closest changing tables (to change diapers), quiet cafés (where you can breastfeed or bottlefeed in peace), feeding-rooms, and also all fun activities for small kids like 
outdoor playgrounds, indoor playgrounds, kids museums, playlands, open kindergartens, petting zoo´s and so on.

Right now this is only a prototype that shows one location, but it gives you the idea.

All icons and illustrations/logos are custom made by me.
